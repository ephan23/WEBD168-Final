<h1>WEBD168 Final Project</h1>

<div class="container">
	
	<div id="content1">
		<h2>Documentation:</h2>
		<p>Estimated time:  3-4 Hours<br>
			Actual time: 5 hours</p>
			
		<p>The CSS3 rules and techniques I used in my project include:<br>
			- Integrated Fonts via Google Fonts <br>&emsp;(<strong>Local</strong>: Roboto, <strong>Web:</strong> Montserrat)<br>
			- Text shadowing for the title<br>
			- Multiple background images<br>
			- Linear Gradient<br>
			- Border/box effects<br>
			- RGBa and HSLa<br>
			- CSS Keyframe and @media
		</p>

			<p>I'm satisfied with the outcome of my project because I was able to incorporate the CSS grid system to make the layout look smoother.<br>
				I was expecting to include more content but I wanted to keep it as simple as it is.
			</p>
			<p>
				A challenge that I faced was with adding multiple backgrounds. For a while I was stuck because I couldn't figure out why one of the images wasn't showing on top of the main background image, but I soon found out that it wasn't prioritizing the image I wanted on top.<br>
				For design, the only challenge I had was thinking about where I should place each element on the page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, I am completely satisfied with the course because I was able to learn new concepts that I didn't know before, such as 3D transformations.
